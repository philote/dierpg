# How to use the system locally

With the change to LevelDB, there is an extra step to create the packs locally.

- Clone the repository as usual
- You need to have a node.js installation done
- You must be in Foundry welcome page (or have it completely closed) and NOT in a world. In the system directory, do : 
    - npm install will generate the node_modules depending on package.json and package-lock.json
    - npm run pullJSONtoLDB will create the packs depending of the content of src/packs directory

# To update the packs
-  Unpack data : npm run pushLDBtoJSON will create the src/packs files and export all actors/items in json files
-  Pack data : npm run pullJSONtoLDB will create the LevelDB folders from the JSON files in the src/packs folder
